Welcome to TbLink RPC's documentation!
======================================

TbLink RPC is a simulation-centric communication framework that is designed
to handle a wide variety of simulation environments and testbench languages.
It emphasizes flexibility and automation, with the goals of supporting 
rich communication between object-oriented environments and dramatically 
simplifying the process of connecting a new reference model to an existing
testbench language, or a new testbench language to an existing simulation 
environment.
